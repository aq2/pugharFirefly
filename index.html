        <article>
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              Ayurvedic Yoga Massage has its origins in India and is an ancient healing system
              that uses an effective combination of powerful deep tissue massage with coordinated
              breath work and yoga stretches.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Ayurvedic system stimulates, opens and balances the flow of energy throughout
              the body, assisting in our own natural tendency towards self-healing.
              
            </p>
            <p>Benefits include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>stress relief</li>
              <li>elimination of toxins</li>
              <li>stimulation of blood circulation</li>
              <li>
                muscular/skeletal realignment leading to improved posture, digestion,
                and increased flexibility
              </li>

          <div class="text">
            <p>
              I am Saghar (Nasrien) Amozgar, Persian in origin.  I came to the UK in 2000 after 8 years
              of study in India, completing my PhD in Psychology and my journey of discovery into yoga,
              meditation, and traditional ayurvedic massage.
            </p>
            <p>
              I studied Ayurvedic Yoga Massage under the expert guidance of Swami Varidi, who trained
              with the renowned Kusum Modak herself.  I qualified in Pune 1999.  I continued to work
              closely with Swami Varidi, organising his courses in Europe and assisting him with their
              delivery in the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was fortunate to study in Pune City in the neighbourhood of the Iyengar ashram.  My
              learning and understanding of yoga continued with my qualification from the Sivananda yoga
              center in Kerala, India in 2004.  Since then I have been teaching many classes including
              Muslim women community centres, children and open classes for all.
            </p>
            <p>
              I established the Ayurvedic Yoga Association in 2004.  My passion is sharing my
              experiences and insights gained over the years of body-work, not only through my
              therapeutic work with individuals, but also by running regular workshops and
              professional standard training courses for practitioners to spread this wonderful
              ancient technique around the globe.

            <p>Ayurvedic Yoga Massage is a form of deep-tissue massage which takes place on a floor mattress. It involves deep strokes and a series of yoga stretches to help to eliminate toxins and rejuvenate the body.</p>
            <p>In Ayurvedic Yoga Massage we use both the feet and the hands to manipulate the joints.</p>
            <p>One of the best things is using calamus powder which helps to stimulate, and is especially good for blood circulation.</p>

              AYM diplomas are divided into two separate levels, each taking a total of 24 hours to complete.
              The courses combine both practical techniques and theory-based learning.  Courses can be either
              intensive - four days of seven-hour sessions (including one hour lunch-break); or non-intensive -
              divided into four eight-hour sessions over two months.

              It is important to have attended a workshop session before taking the training course. Alternatively,
