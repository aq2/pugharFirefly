    p.
      I run regular one day workshops designed to introduce you to the essential basic
      skills of Ayurvedic yoga massage. You will learn how to give a back, neck and

      The workshops cater for complete beginners, or for further enhancing your existing
      skills if you are already a therapist.

    h2 Training Courses
    p.
      AYM diplomas are divided into two separate levels, each taking a total of 24 hours to complete.
      The courses combine both practical techniques and theory-based learning.  Courses can be either
      intensive - four days of seven-hour sessions (including one hour lunch-break); or non-intensive -
      divided into four eight-hour sessions over two months.
    p.
      Fully-detailed illustrated manuals will be provided to each student along with the course.
      The successful applicant will be awarded a Ayurvedic Yoga Massage certificate, according to the level
      of the course.
    p.
      It is important to have attended a workshop session before taking the training course. Alternatively,
      you can have a short interview with Saghar either by phoning her on 07974 470 610 or
      <a href='mailto: saghar@ayurvedicyogamassage.org.uk' class='email'>email</a>.
    p The fee is £350, with a £90 deposit requested 2 weeks before start date.
